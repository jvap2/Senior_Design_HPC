# Senior_Design_HPC
## Benchmarking Parallel Performance: GPUs and FPGAs
### Developers: Jayden Vap and Tessa Rodgers
### Executive Summary:
This Senior Design Project performed by Tessa Rodgers and Jayden Vap will comprise of benchmarking the performance of parallel algorithms run on different hardware and comparing these benchmarks to provide an analysis. The hardware that will be utilized is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which will be programmed accordingly. Each algorithm will have a different approach, thus significant documentation will be necessary, as the analysis will contain the comparison of implementation and performance. In this contract and proposal, the methodology for such a project will be outlined. The intent behind this project can be stated succinctly- this is a study on the future of computation. In the present day, there is an impetus to perform calculations quickly and efficiently with a massive amount of data. Whether that is for the National Weather Service to properly predict the location and time of a tornado to save lives, or to be able to predict precipitation to optimize the planting and harvesting of crops.
